Pre-requisites
===============

The following are the pre-requisites for building PDLTools:

Required:
* Pivotal Greenplum or Apache HAWQ ([GPDB sandbox](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb), [HAWQ sandbox](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-hdb))
* Apache MADlib ([Download](https://madlib.incubator.apache.org/download.html))
* cmake (3.5 recommended)
* GNU C and C++ compilers (gcc, g++)
* Flex (>= 2.5.33)
* Bison (>= 2.4)
* rpmbuild

Optional:
* Doxygen (1.8.7 recommended, if generating HTML docs), 
* LaTeX (if generating PDF docs)


Building
=========

For CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, install the pre-requisite tools:

     sudo yum install cmake gcc gcc-c++ flex bison rpm-build

From either the Greenplum or HAWQ master node, follow these steps as the `gpadmin` user:

     curl -L -o pdltools-1.7.zip https://github.com/pivotalsoftware/PDLTools/archive/v1.7.zip
     unzip  pdltools-1.7.zip 
     cd PDLTools-1.7
     source /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake .. -DRPM_INSTALL_PREFIX=$GPHOME
     curl -L -o third_party/downloads/uriparser-0.7.9.tar.bz2 https://sourceforge.net/projects/uriparser/files/uriparser-0.7.9.tar.bz2
     curl -L -o third_party/downloads/cpptest-1.1.2.tar.gz https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpptest/files/cpptest-1.1.2.tar.gz
     make 2> /dev/null

Generating Doxygen User Docs
=============================

You can generate Doxygen docs for the project as follows:

     make doc

This will create the user docs under $BUILD/doc/user/html. 
You can also generate a PDF of the user doc by running

     cd build/doc/user/latex && make pdf

This will generate a PDF titled `refman.pdf` in $PDLTOOLS/build/doc/user/latex


Packaging
==========

To create an rpm package which you can ship for installation into other machines, run the following (from the build directory):

     make package

When installing on a cluster, it is best to create a gppkg installer. Run the following (from the build directory):

     make gppkg

Installation
=============

Installation is a two-step process. First, you will have to install MADlib _and_ PDL Tools on either the Greenplum or HAWQ master node.
To do this, you will run the following:
    
     gppkg -i <pdltools gppkg file>

For example, run the following (from the build directory):

     gppkg -i deploy/gppkg/2.0/pdltools-1.7-hawq2.0-rhel5-x86_64.gppkg

This will place all the relevant binaries & SQL files at the appropriate location (usually `$GPHOME/pdltools`).
Next, you will have to install the SQL UDFs in the target database.

To install pdltools into a database of your choice, run the following (consider adding `pdlpack` in your PATH):

     $GPHOME/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install [-s <schema name>] [-S <SUgAR schema name>] [-M <MADlib schema name>] -c <username>@<hostname>:<port>/<database name>

For example:

     $GPHOME/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install -s pdltools -c gpadmin@mdw:5432/testdb

The default schemas are `pdltools` for the main schema, `sugarlib` for SUgAR and `madlib` to search for MADlib objects.

Running Install Check Tests
=============================
    
Post installation, you can run the unit tests in PDL Tools with the install-check command like so:

     $GPHOME/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install-check -s pdltools -c gpadmin@mdw:5432/testdb

Parameters for `install-check` are the same as parameters for `install`.
If any of the tests fail, you will see an error message displayed on your console.
