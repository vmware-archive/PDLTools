## Getting PDL Tools

The latest GPPKG version of the PDL Tools library can be found here: 
 - <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/folderview?id=0B43lMs8oQk7xcGJqdlN6SElWOTQ&usp=sharing">PDLTools Binaries (Pivotal internal)</A HREF>

The above link also includes Doxygen docs (html tarball & PDF) as well as RPM installers for PDLTools. We will update the link above with artifacts for everynew release.

Note that HAWQ versions earlier than 1.2.1 do not support GPPKG installation.
For these, see below for installation instructions from RPMs.
Also, because some GPDB features are not currently supported in HAWQ
(e.g. PL/Perl, UPDATEs and the ability to define basic types),
some parts of PDL Tools are available only in GPDB and not
in HAWQ.

## Installing PDL Tools on GPDB

### Prerequisites

PDL Tools can be installed on either a GPDB 4.2 or 4.3. It requires `PL/pgSQL`, `PL/C`, `PL/Python` and `PL/Perl`.
The `Python` version should be at least 2.6, and the `Perl` version should be at least 5.008 but lower than 6.0. PDLTools for HAWQ does not have a dependency on PL/Perl as currently PL/Perl is not available as a gppkg for HAWQ.

<pre class="example">
gppkg -i pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-gpdb4.3-rhel5-x86_64.gppkg
</pre>

For GPDB 4.3 or the equivalent for GPDB 4.2. Run this as gpadmin.

@verbatim
$ gppkg -i pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-gpdb4.3-rhel5-x86_64.gppkg

   "gpadmin" and will prompt for password. The target schema for the main
   library will be "pdltools" (specified here explicitly) and the target
   schema for the SUgAR library, packaged with it, will be "sugarlib"
   (specified here implicitly). MADlib objects will be searched for in the
   "madlib" schema (also specified here implicitly).
   In all cases, these schema choices are the default options.

To uninstall the package, use "gppkg -r".
For additional options run:
$ pdlpack --help

### Installing PDL Tools onto a target database as 'gpadmin'

Use these instructions to install PDL Tools onto a target database if you are
able to log in as 'gpadmin'. If not, refer to the next section.

Run the following command as 'gpadmin'.

<pre class="example">
/usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install [-s <em>schema name</em>] -p greenplum [-S <em>SUgAR schema name</em>] [-M <em>MADlib schema name</em>] -c <em>user\@host:port/database name</em> [-v]
</pre>

where <em>database name</em> should be replaced by the name of the database you wish to install to, <em>schema name</em> is the schema to install to, <em>SUgAR schema name</em> is the schema in which to install the SUgAR library, and <em>MADlib schema name</em> is the schema to search for MADlib objects in. By default, <em>schema name</em> would be "pdltools", <em>SUgAR schema name</em> would be "sugarlib" and <em>MADlib schema name</em> would be "madlib". Typically, <em>user\@host:port</em> is chosen to be "gpadmin@localhost:5433", as in the example below. MADlib objects do not need to be present during PDL Tools installation for it to succeed, though some of the run-time functionality of PDL Tools relies on calling MADlib routines.

The '-v' flag turns on verbose output.

Note that starting with PDL Tools 1.3, specifying '-p greenplum' to set the
platform is mandatory.

@verbatim
$ /usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install -s pdltools -p greenplum -c gpadmin@localhost:5433/exampledb

@endverbatim

Note that this installation may be interactive, asking yes/no questions.

### Installing PDL Tools onto a target database not as 'gpadmin'

If you are unable to log in as 'gpadmin', you can still install PDL Tools onto
a database by modifying the instructions from the previous section as follows.

First, make sure that the GPDB 'MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY' and 'GPHOME' are properly
set in your '~/.bashrc' file and that '$GPHOME/greenplum_path.sh' is
subsequently sourced. Here is an example of lines you can add to your
'~/.bashrc' to create this effect:

<pre class="example">
\# User specific aliases and functions
export MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY=/data/master/gpseg-1
export GPHOME=/usr/local/greenplum-db
source $GPHOME/greenplum_path.sh
</pre>

Next, log into your 'mdw' node. (It is not possible to install PDL Tools
anywhere but on the local host when not logged in as 'gpadmin'.)

As a final step, run the 'pdlpack' installation command, as described in the
previous section, making sure that you list 'localhost' as your target
computer and use your own user name. Here is an example for a typical
installation on a DCA environment.

@verbatim
$ /usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install -s pdltools -p greenplum -c user@localhost:5432/exampledb
@endverbatim

### Checking that the installation was successful (optional)

Once you've installed the package onto your database, you may want to check that the installation was successful. The `install-check` option give you a method to do so.

<pre class="example">
/usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install-check [-s <em>schema name</em>] -p greenplum [-S <em>SUgAR schema name</em>] [-M <em>MADlib schema name</em>] -c <em>user\@host:port/database name</em>
</pre>

where <em>database name</em> should be replaced by the name of the database you installed to, and <em>schema name</em>, <em>SUgAR schema name</em> and <em>MADlib schema name</em> are the schemas (with the same defaults as in the installation command).

Run this command as gpadmin, or follow the instructions in the previous section
in order to run the command as another user.

@verbatim
$ /usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install-check -s pdltools -p greenplum -c gpadmin@localhost:5433/exampledb
pdlpack.py : INFO : Detected greenplum version 4.3ORCA.

## Upgrading

The installation command

<pre class="example">
/usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install [-s <em>schema name</em>] -p <em>platform</em> [-S <em>SUgAR schema name</em>] [-M <em>MADlib schema name</em>] -c <em>user\@host:port/database name</em> [-v]
</pre>

will perform a clean install if no previous version of the library is installed
in the target schemas and will perform an upgrade if the schemas include an
older version of the library.

Beginning with version 1.4 of PDL Tools, the "install" command will verify
that the target schemas either do not exist (in which case it will perform a
clean installation) or that they exist and contain older library versions.
If neither condition applies, installation will terminate with a message.

Upgrading will not back up existing objects to a backup schema. Instead,
objects will be upgraded in-place. Furthermore, database objects will not
be dropped and recreated needlessly. The reason for this is that such
drop/rename actions can cause functionality that depends on the
previously-installed version of the library to cease functioning and/or
database objects outside of the library to be dropped as part of a drop
cascade. Beginning with version 1.4, the installer detects any such
dependencies, reports them and halts installation if dependencies that do
not allow a smooth upgrade are found. It will also warn regarding library
functionality which has been changed in a non-compatible way.

@warning Never alter any object in either the PDL Tools or SUgARlib schema.
Any database objects within the PDL Tools and SUgARlib
schemas that do not belong to the library will be dropped (without warning) as
part of any upgrade.

If upgrade fails for any reason, the installer will roll back the installation,
returning both PDL Tools and SUgARlib schemas to their prior states.

Version 1.4 of the library adds the following further command options, in
addition to "install" and "install-check":
  - <b>uninstall</b> - Uninstall library objects. See "Uninstalling", below.
  - <b>clean-install</b> - Same as "install", but will only work if the target schemas do not already exist.
  - <b>reinstall</b> - Performs uninstallation followed by reinstallation. Use this for cases other than those handled by "install", such as to fix a corrupt installation or to downgrade to an earlier version.
  - <b>list-lib</b> - Reports which database objects belong to the present version of the library (i.e., what objects will be installed at the end of an "install" or "reinstall" command).
  - <b>list-db</b> - Reports which database objects are currently installed in the target schemas.

These extra options are meant to facilitate the various aspects of and
potential issues encountered during library upgrading.

___


## Uninstalling

It is not necessary to uninstall PDL Tools as part of a regular upgrade process. However, if you wish to uninstall the library, this section describes how to do so.

First, uninstall the database objects. This is done by

<pre class="example">
/usr/local/greenplum-db/pdltools/bin/pdlpack uninstall [-s <em>schema name</em>] -p <em>platform</em> [-S <em>SUgAR schema name</em>] -c <em>user\@host:port/database name</em> [-v]
</pre>

The uninstall command has the same effect on the database as

<pre class="example">
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS pdltools CASCADE;
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS sugarlib CASCADE;
</pre>

However, it is preferable to a brute-force drop in that it first checks
whether there are any dependencies that would break or non-library objects
to which the drop will be cascaded. If such exist, uninstallation will halt
and report the discovered issues, rather than perform the potentially very
damaging drop.

After erasing the library objects from the database,
uninstall the library from your computer using the following command.

<pre class="example">
gppkg -r pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@
</pre>

## Installing PDL Tools on HAWQ

PDL Tools is available as a gppkg for HAWQ 1.2.1 and up (including 1.3), and as an rpm for HAWQ 1.2.0 (which does not support GPPKG installation). Currently only a subset of the modules supported on GPDB are available for PDL Tools on HAWQ.
The complex numbers modules is unavailable due to lack of support for User Defined Types (UDTs) yet on HAWQ. The sessionization and sampling modules are unsupported because of the unavailability of a PL/Perl gppkg for HAWQ. Complete Linkage is unsupported due to the lack of an ability to UPDATE tables.

The gppkg installation instructions for HAWQ are similar to those for GPDB.
Change the '-p greenplum' directive to '-p hawq' to set the platform
properly.
We've provided a simple Python based installer for PDL Tools for HAWQ 1.2.0. You can download the install here: <A HREF="scripts/hawq_install">PDL Tools HAWQ Install Script</A>.

You can install PDL Tools on HAWQ 1.2.0 then like so:
<pre class="example">
./hawq_install pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-Linux.rpm $HOME/hostfile
</pre>

Here's a sample installation log on a 4 node cluster, with the `hostfile` containing the entries `mdw`, `sdw1-3`

@verbatim
[gpadmin@mdw]$ ./hawq_install pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-Linux.rpm ../hostfile
Querying mdw for any existing installation of pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-Linux.rpm
package pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@ is not installed
Querying sdw-1  for any existing installation of pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@-Linux.rpm
package pdltools-@PDLTOOLS_VERSION_STRING@ is not installed

@endverbatim

Once the rpm has been installed, you can then install the PDL Tools schema in your target database as listed in the sections above. Here is a sample installation log and install-check log

### Installing PDL Tools for HAWQ in a target database

The "pdlpack" installation script is invoked for HAWQ in exactly the same way
as for GPDB, and with the same command-line options. The only difference is
that one must switch "-p greenplum" for "-p hawq". Here are examples.

@verbatim
[gpadmin@mdw]$ /usr/local/hawq/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install -s pdltools -p hawq -c gpadmin@mdw:5432/testdb

[gpadmin@mdw]$ /usr/local/hawq/pdltools/bin/pdlpack install-check -s pdltools -p hawq -c gpadmin@mdw:5432/testdb
@endverbatim

Due to technical limitations of HAWQ, however, some modules may not be
available on HAWQ.
